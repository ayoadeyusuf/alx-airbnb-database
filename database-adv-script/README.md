# Unleashing Advanced Querying Power

## Complex Queries with Joins
- Using an INNER JOIN to retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

- Using a LEFT JOIN to retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

- Using a FULL OUTER JOIN to retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.

## Subqueries
- Writing a query to find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0 using a subquery.

- Writing a correlated subquery to find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

## Aggregation and Window Functions
- Writing a query to find the total number of bookings made by each user, using the COUNT function and GROUP BY clause.

- Using a window function (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) to rank properties based on the total number of bookings they have received.
